Javascript course

In this repository I will develope an easy To-do list using JavaScript, css and html.

In the application you can make a list of tasks, mark the as done, uncheck them or remove them. The application stores data to local storage and can be refreshed or reopen later with the data intact.

Once finished, I would rate it very good (25 points). It requires me to make it responsive and add the highlighted error field from applications requirements and also additionally I'll also make a drag and drop function which allows user to change the arrengement of tasks.
